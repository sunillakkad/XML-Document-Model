# XML-Document-Model

• Constructed XML parsing facility that reads XML strings/files, builds a Document object that can be queried for information about the XML contents, supports programmatic modification of the Document, and can write the revisions to another XML string/file

• Used the standard C++11 smart pointer types to support memory management instead of directly managing heap allocations, move, and move assignment operations
